# My first app building journey

### 01/17/18

The app is coming along, I now have a tableView of objects, which I retrieve from CoreData.  
As I go, I find myself wishing I could group the code up more, perhaps I can do that with extensions? 
I may have read that somewhere, I'll look into it more later.  The functionality I have so far is to add,
edit, and delete companies from the list.  Next I think we will add pictures to the companies.  Then add 
employees to companies and begin to orgaize them.  Should learn a lot more about tableView and CoreData 
when we do that part.
